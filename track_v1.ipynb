    "# The Radial Distribution Function for Flying Discs\n",

    "In this lab we will investigate the internal _structure_ of particles moving on a 2-dimensional surface.\n",
    "To do so we first use an _analogue simulation_ where small magnetic and repulsive discs move on a flat surface due to air flowing from the sides as well as from underneath to reduce friction (see side view in the figure below). The particles are confined by repulsive, magnetic bars, located on the four sides of the square surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "During simulation, a camera is placed above the surface and three videos with three different numbers of particles, _N_ are provided.\n",
    "This allows us to study how the structure and packing changes with surface concentration.\n",
    "While the videos are pretty to watch, we want to extract exactly how the particles move.\n",
    "For this we analyse all frames in the movies with image recognition software that allows us to extract particle positions (_xy_ coordinates) over time.\n",
    "The extracted coordinates is next used to calculate the so-called\n",
    "[_radial distribution_function (RDF)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_distribution_function), $g(r)$.\n",
    "The RDF is a very interesting property as it describes, on average, how a molecular system is organised, and can be used to extract further thermodynamic information.\n",
